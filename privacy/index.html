<b>Introduction</b>
This Privacy Policy describes how THERAPY COUNCIL and its affiliates (collectively “THERAPY COUNCIL,”
“we,” “our,” “us”) collect, use, share, protect, and otherwise process your personal information through our website
at https://therapycouncil.org/ (hereinafter referred to as the “Platform”). Please note you may be able to browse
certain sections of the Platform without registering. We do not offer any product or service under this Platform
outside India, and your personal data will primarily be stored and processed in India. By visiting the Platform,
providing your information, or availing any product or service offered on the Platform, you expressly agree to be
bound by this Privacy Policy, the Terms of Use, and the applicable service/product terms and conditions, and agree
to be governed by the laws of India, including laws applicable to data protection and privacy. If you do not agree,
please do not use or access our Platform.

<b>Collection</b>
We collect your personal data when you use our Platform and services or otherwise interact with us
during the course of our relationship. Information we may collect includes, but is not limited to, data provided during
sign‑up/registration or use of our Platform such as name, date of birth, address, telephone/mobile number, email ID,
and any information shared as proof of identity or address. With your consent, we may collect certain sensitive
personal data such as bank account, credit/debit card or other payment instrument details, or biometric information
such as facial or other physiological information (to enable certain optional features available on the Platform), all in
accordance with applicable law(s). You always have the option not to provide information by choosing not to use a
particular service or feature on the Platform. We may also track your behaviour, preferences, and other information
you choose to provide on the Platform. This information is compiled and analysed on an aggregated basis. We will
also collect information related to your transactions on the Platform and on third‑party business partner platforms.
Where a third‑party business partner collects your personal data directly from you, you will be governed by their
privacy policies. We are not responsible for any third‑party partner’s privacy practices or the content of their privacy
policies; please read their policies prior to disclosing any information. If you receive an email or call from someone
claiming to be from THERAPY COUNCIL requesting personal data such as your debit/credit card PIN, net‑banking
or mobile banking password, do not provide such information. If you have already revealed such information, report
it immediately to the appropriate law enforcement agency.

<b>Usage</b>
We use personal data to provide the services you request. Where we use your personal data for marketing,
we will provide you the ability to opt out. We use your personal data to assist sellers and business partners in
handling and fulfilling orders; enhance customer experience; resolve disputes; troubleshoot problems; inform you
about online and offline offers, products, services, and updates; customise your experience; detect and protect against
error, fraud and other criminal activity; enforce our terms and conditions; conduct marketing research, analysis and
surveys; and as otherwise described at the time of collection. Your access to certain products/services may be
affected if permission is not provided to us.

<b>Sharing</b>
We may share your personal data internally within our group entities, corporate entities and affiliates to
provide you access to services and products offered by them. These entities and affiliates may market to you as a
result of such sharing unless you explicitly opt out. We may disclose personal data to third parties such as sellers,
business partners and service providers, including logistics partners, prepaid payment instrument issuers, third‑party
reward programmes and other payment providers chosen by you. These disclosures may be required to provide you
access to our services/products, comply with legal obligations, enforce our user agreement, facilitate our marketing
and advertising activities, and prevent, detect, mitigate and investigate fraudulent or illegal activities related to our
services. We may disclose personal and sensitive personal data to government agencies or other authorised law
enforcement agencies if required by law or in the good‑faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to
respond to subpoenas, court orders or other legal processes. We may also disclose personal data to law enforcement
offices, third‑party rights owners, or others in the good‑faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to:
enforce our Terms of Use or this Privacy Policy; respond to claims that an advertisement, posting or other content
violates the rights of a third party; or protect the rights, property or personal safety of our users or the general public.

<b>Security Precautions</b>
We adopt reasonable security practices and procedures to protect your personal data from
unauthorised access or disclosure, loss or misuse. Once your information is in our possession, and whenever you
access your account information, we adhere to our security guidelines to protect it and offer the use of a secure
server. However, transmission of information over the internet is not completely secure for reasons beyond our
control. By using the Platform, you accept the security implications of data transmission over the internet and the
World Wide Web, which cannot always be guaranteed as completely secure; therefore, certain inherent risks will
remain. Users are responsible for safeguarding their account login and password details.

<b>Data Deletion and Retention</b>
You may delete your account via your profile and settings on our Platform. This
action will result in the loss of all information related to your account. You may also write to us at the contact
information provided below for assistance. In the event of any pending grievances, claims, shipments or other
services, we may refuse or delay deletion of the account. Once the account is deleted, you will lose access to it. We
retain your personal data for no longer than is required for the purposes for which it was collected or as required
under applicable law. However, we may retain data if necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse or for other
legitimate purposes. We may continue to retain your data in anonymised form for analytical and research purposes.

<b>Your Rights</b>
You may access, rectify and update your personal data directly through the functionalities provided
on the Platform.

<b>Consent</b>
By visiting our Platform or by providing your information, you consent to the collection, use, storage,
disclosure and processing of your information on the Platform in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you disclose
to us any personal data relating to other people, you represent that you have the authority to do so and permit us to
use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. By providing your personal data over the Platform or any
partner platforms or establishments, you consent to us (including our corporate entities, affiliates, lending partners,
technology partners, marketing channels, business partners and other third parties) contacting you through SMS,
instant messaging apps, calls and/or e‑mail for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy. You may withdraw your
consent by writing to the Grievance Officer at the contact information provided below with the subject line
“Withdrawal of consent for processing personal data.” We may verify such requests before acting. Please note that
withdrawal of consent will not be retrospective and will be in accordance with the Terms of Use, this Privacy Policy
and applicable laws. If you withdraw consent required for certain services, we may restrict or deny provision of those
services.

<b>Changes to this Privacy Policy</b>
Please check this Privacy Policy periodically for changes. We may update this
Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our information practices and may notify you of significant changes as required by
applicable laws.
